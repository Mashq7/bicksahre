BikeShare
### Description
This project is a Python script that allows users to analyze bike share data for three major cities: Chicago, New York, and Washington. Users can choose a city, a specific month, and a day of the week to perform various analyses on the bike share data.
- City Selection: Users can choose one of the three supported cities (Chicago, New York, or Washington) for analysis.

- Date Selection: Users can specify a month and a day of the week for the analysis.

* Data Visualization: The script provides an overview of the available data by displaying column names from the dataset.

- Intelligent Features: It calculates and displays insights like the least busy hours for the selected day and the overall least busy hour.

* Most Frequent Times of Travel: Users can find out the most common month, day, and hour for bike share trips.

* Most Popular Stations and Trips: The script identifies the most common start and end stations for bike share trips.

* Trip Duration Analysis: It calculates the total trip duration and average travel time for the selected month and day.

* User Stats: The script provides statistics on user types (Subscribers and Customers), gender distribution, and user birth years.

* Individual Trip Data: Users have the option to view individual trip data for deeper analysis.

* Restart Option: After completing the analysis, users can choose to restart the program or exit.
